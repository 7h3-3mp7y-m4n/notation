# Notary V2 (nv2)

nv2 will eventually become a set of reference implementations for signing and verifying [OCI Artifacts][artifacts-repo].

Currently, it hosts prototypes to validate the scenarios outlined in [notaryproject/requirements](https://github.com/notaryproject/requirements/blob/main/scenarios.md#scenarios).

## Table of Contents

1. [Notary v2 Home][notaryv2-home]
1. [Prototype 1][prototype-1] - signing and verifying OCI artifacts, using signatures persisted as OCI Indexes.
1. [TUF Prototype][prototype-tuf] - prototype that uses theupdateframework (TUF) for verification of OCI artifacts.
